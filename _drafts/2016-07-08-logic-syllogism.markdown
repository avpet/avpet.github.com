# Силлогизм

Силлогизм - в самом общем смысле прием, который заключается в том, что рассуждение начинается с общих утверждений и заканчивается конкретным выводом. 

Приведем пример. Мы начинаем с общего положения 

“Все люди смертны” 

также мы знаем, что 

“Кай - человек” 

следовательно

“Кай смертен”. 

Т.е. это дедуктивный, основанный на выводе, метод рассуждения. Таким образом, силлогизм - вид логического доказательства, при котором частное положение доказывается при посредстве общих положений. 

Аристотель первым проанализировал силлогизмы в своей "Первой аналитике". Силлогизмы Аристотеля строятся из трех ‘посылок’, каждая из которых представляет собой одну из следующих форм (обозначения A, E, I и O являются де-факто стандартом, хотя сам Аристотель их не использовал):

A – все S есть P (universal affirmative),
E – no S are P (universal negative),
I – some S are P (particular affirmative),
O – some S are not P (particular negative).

We notice in the above example that Syllogism is a three-part set of statements; a major statement or premise, a minor statement or premise and a conclusion that is deduced. Therefore, “All men are mortal” is a major statement or premise which stands as a general fact. “John is a man” is minor statement or premise that is specific and “John is mortal” is the logical conclusion deduced from the two prior statements.
Syllogism and Enthymeme

Syllogism takes the form of Enthymeme when it is compressed. Enthymeme combines the minor premise and the conclusion and omitting the major statement. For instance, a syllogism “All dogs are canine. Tommy is a dog. Therefore, Tommy is a canine.” can be compressed in an enthymeme as “Tommy is a canine because it is a dog.” The major premise remains implied or hidden.
Syllogism Fallacy

Syllogism may also be used to form incorrect conclusions that are odd. For instance, “All crows are black and the bird in my cage is black. So, the bird in my cage is a crow.” This is a false argument as it implies a conclusion “all blackbirds are crows” is incorrect. It is known as Syllogism Fallacy. Another example of Syllogism fallacy is “Some televisions are black and white and all penguins are black and white. Therefore, some televisions are penguins”. You can easily see that the conclusion is practically impossible and in fact has a comical outcome.
Syllogism Examples in Literature

Let us look at some examples of syllogism in literature:

1. Shakespeare employs this rhetorical device in his play “Timon of Athens” Act 4, scene 3:

    “Flavius: Have you forgot me, sir?
    Timon: Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
    Then, if thou grant’st thou’rt a man, I have forgot thee.”

Timon uses a witty syllogism to tell Flavius that he must have forgotten him like he has forgotten all other men. It can be expanded in a three-set argument as; “I usually do forget as I have forgotten everyone. Therefore, I have forgotten you as well.”

2. Poetry is known for its passion and not reason but we find syllogistic argument in Andrew Marvell’s poem “To his Coy Mistress”. The poet says to his bashful beloved, “Had we but world enough, and time. This coyness, Lady, were no crime.” It implies a general truth that life is short and man is mortal. They do not have enough time to love and cannot waste it in display of coyness.

Likewise, he and his darling may separate eternally before their union in this world is established. Therefore, he says, “But at my back I always hear/ Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;” and speaks to his beloved, “Thy beauty shall no more be found,”. The poet reaches a conclusion that they should avail themselves of the time they have, “Now let us sport us while we may,”

3. Compressed syllogism is found in famous metaphysical poet John Donne’s poem “ Elegy 2 The Anagram”:

    “All love is wonder; if we justly do
    Account her wonderful, why not lovely too?”

If we expand the above Syllogism, it will have the following organization of statements; “All that is lovable is wonderful and the mistress is wonderful. Therefore, the mistress is lovable.”
Function of Syllogism

In logic, syllogism aims at identify the general truths in a particular situation. It is a tool in the hands of a speaker or a writer to persuade the audience or the readers as their belief in a general truth may tempt them to believe in a specific conclusion drawn from those truths.
In literature, syllogism can contribute to add wit to the statements. Moreover, Syllogism fallacy may give us an opportunity to enjoy the nonsensical conclusion.
